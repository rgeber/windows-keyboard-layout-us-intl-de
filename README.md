# Windows Keyboard Layout US - German Umlauts

Custom US based keyboard layout adding Umlauts via the right <ALT> key. Once installed the layout will show up as `English (US, intl., German) in your layout selector.

Tested with Windows 10 Pro.

## Installation

Run the installer.

Once installed you'll be able to add/select a keyboard layout called `US-de` in the systems's keyboard settings. It's usually there after you ran the installer. I then just delete the standard US layout and use `US-de` exclusively.

## Using the source file

The source file can be edited using the [Microsoft Keyboard Layout Creator](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/download/details.aspx?id=22339).

You may use it to customize the layout even further and/or build your own installer.

## Usage

Once active, you'll be able to type `äÄ`, `öÖ`, `üÜ` and `ß` holding down your **right alt key** and optionally the shift key. No compose key nonesense but smooth on the fly typing.

| Combination       | Result |
|-------------------|--------|
| RAlt + a          | ä      |
| RAlt + o          | ö      |
| RAlt + u          | ü      |
| RAlt + Shift + a  | Ä      |
| RAlt + Shift + o  | Ö      |
| RAlt + Shift + u  | Ü      |
| RAlt + s          | ß      |


Have fun!
